## Your Privacy

**Privacy**
We understand that most websites shared on Discord are scams. They tend to steal your credentials and information but rest assured that we are not one of them.

> We **do not** store any form of data as **we don't** have any third party services other than Google Analytics.

> Our code is **fully open sourced** and available for inspection on the Github repository.

> We **do not** have a backend server. Everything runs on the frontend.

> We run the website using Github Pages (pages.github.com) directly from the main repository. [https://github.com/peterhanania/Discord-Package/deployments/activity_log?environment=github-pages](https://github.com/peterhanania/Discord-Package/deployments/activity_log?environment=github-pages)

> No database, no storage or any other form of data is stored.

**If you do not trust the site, we are working on a desktop version for you guys! Or you could turn off your WiFi connection and use the site and you can keep an eye on the network tab on your browser to ensure your data isn’t sent anywhere.**
