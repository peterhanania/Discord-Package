### Can I trust this Website?

We understand that most websites shared on Discord are scams. They tend to steal your credentials and information but rest assured that we are not one of them.

- We do not store any form of data

- Our code is fully open sourced and available for inspection on the Github repository.
- We do not have a backend server. Everything runs on the frontend.

- We run the website using Github Pages ([pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/)) directly from the main repository. [github action](https://github.com/peterhanania/Discord-Package/deployments/activity_log?environment=github-pages)
- No database, no storage or any other form of data is stored.

If you find a security issue or have any other questions, please contact me at peter@peterhanania.com
